This study explores the creation of an model utilizing artificial intelligence to predict patient drowsiness levels under sedative influence. As patients are placed under varying concentrations of a sedative, they enter states off of consciousness from awake to completely unconscious. This study seeks to develop a model that is capable of detecting the patient's state of drowinsess solely through resting state EEG data in order to help determine the amount of additional sedative to administer to ensure patient sedation throughout an operation.
